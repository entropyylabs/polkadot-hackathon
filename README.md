# Stamps!

A unified passport of “stamps!” from your beloved brands collected at unique locations.

### Tech Stack :

Unique Network is the next-generation NFT chain for advanced use cases and mass adoption. We are leveraging the power of the unique network and the underlying Polkadot ecosystem.
Wallets are a big barrier when it comes to mass adoption, we are creating non-custodial wallets on the unique network when users signup using their email id and password. This provides an abstraction over wallet creation and makes mass adoption easy.

We are using nested NFTs on the unique network to create geo-tagged NFTs. Every parent NFT has nested child NFTs, these child NFTs are associated with the benefits that every brand provides. Once these benefits have been claimed these child NFTs are burned.

The web application is made using ReactJS, firebase auth and cloud functions.
